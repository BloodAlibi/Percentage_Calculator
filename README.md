# PercentageCalculator
**Percentage Calculator is a Python tool to convert two numbers into a percentage.** For example, it will return 50% if your inputs are 1 and 2, or 3 and 6, or 5 and 1o, or more.

## How to use

This tool is very easy to use. The program will first ask for your first number. If you wish to have the percentage of 1 out of 3, it would be the 1.
Then you will be asked for your second number. With the same example, it would be the 3.
The program will then return the percentage of the first number in the second number.
